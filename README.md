# SignBridge
SignBridge is a Python-based computer vision application designed to assist in bridging the communication gap within the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This project leverages Machine Learning (TensorFlow/Keras) and Computer Vision (OpenCV, MediaPipe) to translate American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets into real-time text.
